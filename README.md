## Emacs init.el with Org Babel

This is just my **emacs** init configuration done in one **org-mode** file. I
use org-modes *babel* support to generate the `*.el` files used in my configuration

The repository contains a <kbd>setup.el</kbd> and a <kbd>setup.sh</kbd> scripts
which you can run to generate the <kbd>init.el</kbd> file

There are multiple init files in this repository

- init.org My original and working init setup
- new-init.org My current experimental init setup. May have bugs.
- minimal.org A minimal, only the bare essentials init file

**Use at your own risk**
